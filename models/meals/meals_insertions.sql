    Combine hot dogs, mustard, brown sugar, cayenne pepper, onion powder, and black pepper in a large resealable bag. Shake bag so hot dogs are well coated with mustard and spice mixture. Spread out seasoned hot dogs onto the prepared baking sheet.
    Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour.
    Remove hot dogs and cut them into thirds. Increase oven temperature to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
    Combine hot dog pieces and BBQ sauce in a bowl and mix until hot dogs are completely coated with sauce. Return to the baking sheet.

    "My family has a motto we frequently apply to our weeknight dinner routine: “When in doubt, roast some broccoli.” It’s the one vegetable side dish that all four of us are sure to eat—even my picky five year old. And it’s fairly easy to understand why: Roasted broccoli ticks all the boxes for a great vegetable side dish: It’s simple to prepare, delicious, and nutritious. But as my family’s resident home chef (and a former professional chef), what I like best about roasted broccoli is how easy it is to dress it up with a variety of ingredients and flavor profiles, avoiding the same boring side dish night after night.",

    "This cake is a deeply caramelized cousin of American cheesecake, inspired by the famous “tarta de queso” by Santiago Riviera of La Viña in Donostia-San Sebastián, Spain. Its defining features are a burnt top and barely set center, the result of baking the eggy cream cheese batter at a very high temperature. To achieve the perfect balance between the deeply browned top and creamy center, we chill the batter after mixing, and sprinkle the top with sugar right before the cake goes into a 400-degree oven.",

    "Suya is Nigerian street food at its finest—think nutty, spicy beef threaded onto skewers then grilled, the finished sticks cradled in paper or foil with a side of fresh tomatoes, sliced red onions, and a sprinkling of yajin kuli. Yajin kuli is made from yaji—a blend of chiles, ginger, garlic, onions, salt and other spices—and ground kuli kuli, which is essentially dehydrated and defatted groundnut (peanut) paste. Suya originated in the north of Nigeria, where the knowledge and mastery of meat is second to none.",

    "At its core, braciole is a kind of involtini—a stuffed and rolled piece of meat. The details that define braciole can vary by region in Italy, and even by household. The meat type (pork or beef), the rolling size (one larger roll to share or smaller individual bundles), cooking method (braised, pan-fried, or grilled) and seasoning elements (breadcrumbs, chunks of cheese, or fresh herbs) are examples of the different directions this seemingly simple meat bundle recipe can take.",
