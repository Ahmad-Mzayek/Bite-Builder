        <br>- Carefully add broccoli to preheated baking sheet in a single layer.
        <br>- Roast until broccoli is tender and deeply browned in spots, about 20 minutes (for the deepest browning on only one side, do not flip the broccoli during cooking; for more even browning all over, toss and flip broccoli about halfway through roasting).
        <br><br><h2>For cooking broccoli in the air fryer:</h2>
        <br>- Preheat a 6-quart air fryer to 400°F (205ºC) for 5 minutes.
        <br>- Meanwhile, in a large bowl, toss broccoli with oil, salt, and pepper to evenly coat.
        <br>- Working in batches if necessary, pour broccoli into the air fryer basket in an even layer and cook until broccoli is still bright green but starting to char around edges, about 5 minutes.
        <br>- Remove basket from air fryer and shake to toss broccoli florets.
        <br>- Return to air fryer and decrease temperature to 340°F (170ºC).

        <br>- Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 400°F (200°C).
        <br>- Cut two 12- by 16-inch pieces of parchment paper.
        <br>- Arrange the 12- by 16-inch pieces of parchment in an overlapping pattern to line a greased 9- by 3-inch springform cake pan, leaving at least 1 to 3 inches of parchment overhanging the rim of the pan on all sides.
        <br>- Set aside.
        <br>- In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine cream cheese and 9 1/2 ounces (270g) sugar.
        <br>- Mix on medium-low speed, scraping down sides of bowl as needed, until no lumps of cheese remain, sugar is dissolved, and mixture is smooth, 3 to 4 minutes.
        <br>- With mixer on medium-low speed, add eggs one at a time, beating for 10 seconds before adding the next.
        <br>- Add egg yolks, and beat on low speed until fully incorporated, 5 to 10 seconds.
        <br>- Stop the mixer and scrape down sides of the bowl with a silicone spatula, making sure the mixture is smooth and homogenous.
        <br>- Add cream, vanilla, lemon zest, and salt.
        <br>- Mix on low speed until fully combined and smooth, about 15 seconds.
        <br>- Using a fine-mesh strainer, sift flour over batter.
        <br>- Beat on low speed just until combined, 15 to 30 seconds, stopping to scrape down sides of bowl as needed.
        <br>- Pour batter into prepared pan, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes and up to 1 hour.
        <br>- When ready to bake, remove cake pan from refrigerator, set on a rimmed baking sheet, and sprinkle remaining 1 tablespoon (15g) sugar evenly over surface of batter.
        <br>- Bake cheesecake, rotating pan 180 degrees halfway, until cheesecake jiggles as a whole, surface is deeply browned, and the outer edge feels slightly firm but the inner 4 1/2 to 5 inches still seems wobbly and underdone, 50 to 60 minutes.
        <br>- You can also check doneness with an instant-read thermometer: the cheesecake is done when the very center registers between 150 and 155ºF (65.5 to 68ºC) when an instant-read thermometer is inserted to a depth of 2 inches.
        <br>- If you would like more color on your cheesecake you can give it a brief stint under the broiler with your oven rack positioned about 7 inches from the top heating element.
        <br>- Be sure to keep a close eye on it as it can go from brown to burned very quickly.
        <br>- Let cheesecake cool in the pan on a wire rack at room temperature for 1 hour.
        <br>- Refrigerate uncovered for at least 4 hours before unmolding.
        <br>- To unmold the cheesecake, unlatch springform pan and remove pan sides.
        <br>- Holding by parchment overhang, carefully transfer cake to a cutting board or serving plate.
        <br>- Gently peel back parchment from sides of cheesecake, and use a sharp knife to cut into wedges.
        <br>- Serve chilled or allow the cheesecake to come to room temperature before serving.
        <br>- Leftover cheesecake can be covered and refrigerated for up to 3 days.
        <br>- The cheesecake can be made up to 3 days in advance; once cooled to room temperature after baking, wrap tightly with plastic and refrigerate for up to 3 days.

        <br><br><h2>For the Yajin Kuli:</h2>
        <br>- In a small mixing bowl, combine groundnut/peanut butter powder, ground ginger, sweet paprika, onion powder, kosher salt, garlic powder, cayenne pepper powder, ground grains of selim (if desired), cubeb pepper, and ground cloves.
        <br>- Whisk to mix thoroughly, about 30 seconds.
        <br>- Set aside.
        <br><br><h2>For the Suya:</h2>
        <br>- Wrap beef tightly in plastic wrap and place on a plate or small baking sheet and set in the freezer until the beef is partially frozen and firm to the touch, 15 to 30 minutes.
        <br>- Using a sharp chef's knife or slicing knife, slice beef against the grain into 2-inch-long, 1-inch-wide, and 1/8-inch-thick strips (The easiest and most efficient way to do this is to start by portioning the beef into 2-inch-wide by 1-inch-thick pieces, and then slicing those pieces crosswise into 1/8-inch-thick strips.).
        <br>- Place sliced beef in large mixing bowl and drizzle peanut oil over it.
        <br>- Sprinkle 1/2 cup of yajin kuli over the beef and carefully toss and massage spice rub into beef until it is evenly coated.
        <br>- Cover, place in refrigerator, and allow beef to marinate for at least 30 minutes and up to 8 hours.
        <br>- Working with one piece of beef at a time, thread beef onto skewers, piercing each piece through twice to secure it, then bunching meat tightly together like an accordion.
        <br>- Continue threading beef onto skewer, making sure it's bunched tightly together, leaving no parts of the skewer exposed except for a 2-inch handle at the bottom and the pointy tip at the top.
        <br>- Repeat skewering process with remaining beef.
        <br><br><h2>If Using Skewer-Specific Grill Setup:</h2>
        <br>- Set up grill for skewers, making sure to adjust distance between bricks to the length of your skewers.
        <br>- Light a chimney full of charcoal.
        <br>- When all the charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and spread the coals evenly in the channel between bricks.
        <br>- Place skewers directly over the hot coals, balancing them on top of the bricks, with the handles overhanging the bricks closest to you, and the tips balancing on the farther wall of bricks.
        <br>- Cook, turning frequently, until beef is lightly charred and a piece of beef looks cooked through when removed and cut in half, about 8 minutes.
        <br>- If flare-ups occur, move the skewers around as needed to get them away from the flames.
        <br>- Place skewers on grate and cook over direct heat, turning once, until charred on both sides and a piece of beef looks cooked through when removed and cut in half, about 8 minutes.
        <br>- Transfer to serving platter and let rest 2 to 3 minutes.
        <br><br><h2>If Using Conventional Charcoal or Gas Grill:</h2>
        <br>- Light 1 chimney full of charcoal.
        <br>- When all charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and spread coals evenly over half of coal grate.
        <br>- Alternatively, set half the burners of a gas grill to high heat.
        <br>- Set cooking grate in place, cover grill, and allow to preheat for 5 minutes.
        <br>- Clean and oil grilling grate.
        <br>- Transfer to serving platter and let rest 2 to 3 minutes.
        <br><br><h2>For Serving:</h2>
        <br>- Serve with reserved yajin kuli, thinly sliced red onions, tomatoes, lime halves, crisp lettuce, and coriander leaves and tender stems.

        <br>- Arrange oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 350°F (175°C).
        <br><br><h2>For the Braciole:</h2>
        <br>- In a medium bowl, add breadcrumbs, Parmigiano-Reggiano, parsley, pine nuts, olive oil, garlic, 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, and red pepper flakes and stir until well combined.
        <br>- Set aside.
        <br>- If using a top round roast, slice roast into six 1/2 -inch slices.
        <br>- If using pre-sliced beef, skip the next step.
        <br>- Lay steak slices 3 inches apart on a cutting board and cover with plastic wrap.
        <br>- Using meat pounder, flatten slices into rough rectangles measuring no more than 1/4 inch thick.
        <br>- Sprinkle both sides of steaks with salt and remaining 1/2 teaspoon black pepper.
        <br>- Spread the reserved breadcrumb mixture evenly over steaks, then place 1 slice of prosciutto over each breadcrumb-topped steak, folding prosciutto to fit and pressing firmly into steak.
        <br>- Being careful to keep filling in place and starting from a short end of each steak, roll each steak to form a small bundle.
        <br>- Tie each bundle with 2 pieces of kitchen twine to secure.
        <br><br><h2>For the Sauce:</h2>
        <br>- In a large sauté pan, heat oil over medium-high heat until shimmering.
        <br>- Add braciole bundles and brown on all sides, 6 to 8 minutes total.
        <br>- Transfer browned braciole to a clean plate; set aside.
        <br>- Add onion and salt to the now-empty pan and cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until translucent, about 6 minutes.
        <br>- Add garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until just fragrant, about 1 minute.
        <br>- Stir in wine, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan, and cook until mixture reduces by half, about 5 minutes.
        <br>- Stir in tomatoes and water.
        <br>- Nestle the browned braciole bundles into the sauce and bring the sauce to a simmer.
        <br>- Cover the pan with an oven-safe lid or aluminum foil.
        <br>- Place the pan on a rimmed baking sheet and transfer to the oven.
        <br>- Cook, covered, flipping braciole halfway through, for 90 minutes.
        <br>- Carefully remove the lid, flip the braciole again, and continue to cook until the meat is fully tender and sauce thickened to gravy-like consistency, 15 to 45 minutes longer.
        <br>- Season sauce with salt to taste.
        <br>- Use scissors to cut off twine around each bundle.
        <br>- Transfer braciole to a large serving platter or individual plates and spoon sauce overtop.
        <br>- Serve.
        <br>- Cooked braciole with sauce can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 5 days or frozen for up to 3 months.

        <br>- First, beat the yolks with a generous pinch of salt.
        <br>- Adding the salt early is important because you don't want to deflate the mixture later while trying to evenly distribute it into the beaten whites.
        <br>- You want to add a little more salt than it might seem like the yolks need, since you'll want enough to also season the whites.
        <br>- Next, beat the whites to stiff peaks, which means they won't slump over when lifted with a whisk.
        <br>- Just as with the classic soufflé, I'm a proponent of putting in a little elbow grease to beat the whites by hand.
        <br>- It gives you more control and makes it easy to spot the right moment when the eggs hit that perfect stage of firmness: In the left image above, you can see that soft peaks will gently bend.
        <br>- Stiff peaks, pictured on the right, will stick straight up.
        <br>- It's not nearly as strenuous as some people make it out to be.
        <br>- That said, you're free to use a hand mixer or a stand mixer, if you prefer.
        <br>- Fold half the whites into the yolks to loosen them.
        <br>- Don't worry too much about deflating this first addition of whites; it's more important to get a well-mixed, loose base.
        <br>- This is the point where I'd mix in any flavorings, like herbs or cheese, which I strongly recommend—a plain-egg soufflé omelette is not nearly as tasty as one might imagine.
        <br>- It's as if the incorporated air brings out a kind of raw-egg aroma (This is something that often bothers me about meringues, too).
        <br>- Cheese manages to cover that flavor up.
        <br>- After that, you can gently fold in the remaining whites until they're just incorporated.
        <br>- I've seen recipes for soufflé omelettes that either do or don't call for covering the pan.
        <br>- I've tried both methods and had terrible results with the uncovered version, which left too much of the top layer soupy and raw (and I'm a guy who likes a runny omelette).
        <br>- I had much better results when I covered the pan just long enough for the eggs to barely set the top and for any extra cheese you may have scattered on top (why wouldn't you add extra?) to melt.
        <br>- Then slide it out of the pan onto a plate, folding the fluffy behemoth over itself.
        <br>- It's an impressive sight and even more fun to eat, so tender and light.
        <br>- Regardless of which type of soufflé was first invented, this is the one that'll be first on your list of soufflés to make with any frequency, because it's so darned easy.
